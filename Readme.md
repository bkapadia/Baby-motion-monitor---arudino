## Baby SIDS Prevention Device

The purpose of this device is to alert the care provider that a baby has turned to a prone position while sleeping.
Sleeping in a prone position could result in the reduced air intake. This could result in suffocation as infants under 1 
year of age are unable to lift their heads causing breathing passages to be blocked.
